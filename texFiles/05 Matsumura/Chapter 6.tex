\section{Theorem 6.2.}

In the proof for the first claim, it states that $\mathfrak p\cap S=\emptyset$. 
Suppose on the contrary that there exist $y\in \mathfrak p\cap S$. While $\mathfrak p=\Ann(x)$, then 
\begin{align*}
    x =&~ 1 \cdot x = 1/y\cdot y \cdot x = 0.
\end{align*}And this is a contradiction.
