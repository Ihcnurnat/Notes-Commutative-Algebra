\subsection{Definition 3.17}

We can easily generalise the argument in \ref{Atiyah Chapter 1 Ex 8.} to conclude the existence of minimal prime over a given ideal.

\subsection{Ex 3.16}
Notice that in general intersection of two prime ideals are not necessarily prime. For example, take intersection of $\langle 2\rangle,\langle 3\rangle\subset \mathbb Z$ will give us $\langle 6\rangle$, which isn't a prime ideal. However, taking intersection in a \textit{chain} of prime ideals will give us, again, a prime ideal.
