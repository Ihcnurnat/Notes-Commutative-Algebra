\subsection{Example 3) Page 51}

My question was about that quotient ring... 

See a post \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/93478/is-each-power-of-a-prime-ideal-a-primary-ideal}{HERE}. 

See a post dicussing the quotient ring $k[x,y,z]/\langle xy-z^2\rangle$ \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3320367/mathbbcx-y-z-xy-z2-is-not-a-field}{HERE}. 

\subsection{Prop 4.2}

For the original proof. Note that $A/\mathfrak a$ is a local ring, then elements in $A/\mathfrak a$ is either a unit or a nonunit. In case of a nonunit, it lies in the nilradical (intersection of all prime ideals).

Another proof is \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/649146/an-ideal-whose-radical-is-maximal-is-primary}{HERE}.
